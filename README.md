# Reinforcement-Learning

Implementations and explorations of core **Reinforcement Learning** algorithms and concepts. Explores how intelligent agents learn optimal policies through interaction with their environment, using rewards to improve decision-making.

## Folders

- **Ant Tournament** - A multi-agent simulation where artificial agents learn locomotion policies in complex environments using neural networks and policy gradients
- **Bandits** - Implementations of the multi-armed bandit problem, including exploration-exploitation strategies (ε-greedy, UCB, and decaying epsilon strategies)
- **CartPole** - Policy gradient methods (REINFORCE) applied to the classic cart-pole balancing task
- **Easy21** - Simplified blackjack environment for comparing different control algorithms including Monte Carlo Control, Q-Learning, TD(λ), and Linear Function Approximation
